/*
 AI Player models a connect player that does not take in user input.
 The makeDecision(board:) method decides where to make a move and takes in
 the game board as an input.
 
 -> To create a smarter/more sophisticated AI player, all we would need to do
 is create a subclass of AIPlayer and override its makeDecision(board:) method
 with a more complex algorithm.
